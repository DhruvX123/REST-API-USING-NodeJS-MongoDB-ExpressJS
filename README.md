# REST-API-USING-NodeJS-MongoDB-ExpressJS
It is a simple Node.js backend application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books stored in a MongoDB database. The application includes additional features such as pagination, search functionality and Swagger UI.

> API Endpoints

• GET /items

Fetch a list of all items with optional pagination and search query parameters.

Example: GET '/items?page=1&limit=1&title=mockingbird'

• GET /items/

Fetch a single item by its ID.

Example: GET '/items/60d2c6b7e87a3a3b5c71c416'

• POST /items

Example:

• DELETE /items/

Delete an item by its ID.

Example: DELETE '/items/60d2c6b7e87a3a3b5c71c416'

- Additional Feature

I have implemented Swagger dependency in the API. It is a framework in which we can test our REST APIs for different HTTP requests i.e. :

GET

POST

PUT

DELETE

Swagger documentation is available at 'http://localhost:3000/api-docs'. You can use this interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

- Bonus Implemented

Pagination: The GET '/items' endpoint supports pagination through the 'page' and 'limit' query parameters.

Search Functionality: The GET '/items' endpoint supports searching by 'title' and 'authorOrDirector' through query parameters.
